Pokemon Red and Green were first launched on February 27, 1996 in Japan then followed shortly after with Pokemon Blue version. A revamped version of Pokemon Red and Blue then came out and was released on September 28, 1998 in the U.S whereas the Pokemon Green was never released outside of Japan. These games you captured, trained, battled, and traded to become the Pokemon Master. The game quickly became popular and Pokemon easily became one of the most sought out games of the century.
